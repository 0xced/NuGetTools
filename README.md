# NuGet Tools

A website containing some various tools to help understand NuGet.

## Live Website

You can visit NuGet Tools at http://nugettoolsdev.azurewebsites.net/.

## Supported features

- Parse a NuGet framework
- Parse a NuGet package version
- Parse a NuGet package version range
- Test NuGet framework compatibility
- Compare two NuGet package versions
- Test get nearest NuGet framework algorithm
- Test if a version satisfies a version range

## Future

I'd like to add the following features in the future:

- Selecting an arbitrary NuGet version
- Interacting with real NuGet packages (either uploaded or from a source)
- Better copy-pasting so you can easily get a snippet to drop in an email or document
- End-to-end tests
- REST API
- CI
